# Tether.

**R&D by Stroma Labs.**

### "You didn't fail. You just overheated."

Tether is not a career coach. It is an **Evolutionary Profiler**.
Most high-performers do not burn out because they are weak. They burn out because of **System Incompatibility**.

Tether uses **Gemini 2.0 Flash** to analyze your resume and diagnose the "Physics of the Crash." It determines your biological archetype and explains why your specific strengths triggered a toxic system's immune response.

### Core Architecture (V5.0)

Tether V5.0 moves beyond "Keywords" and operates on "Principles of Friction."

**1. The Species (Identity)**
Are you a **Builder** (Kinetic Energy), a **Bridge** (Conductive Energy), or an **Operator** (Structural Energy)? We don't use corporate titles. We define your metabolic function.

**2. The Friction (Physics)**
Burnout is heat. Heat is generated when a high-velocity object hits a low-velocity environment. Tether calculates where the friction occurred (e.g., *Speed vs. Stasis* or *Connection vs. Silos*).

**3. The Gaslight Decoder**
Toxic systems often rename "Strengths" as "Weaknesses" to maintain control. Tether reverses this process:
* *They called you "Aggressive"* $\rightarrow$ *Tether identifies you as "High-Velocity."*
* *They called you "Disruptive"* $\rightarrow$ *Tether identifies you as "Truth-Seeking."*

### Privacy Protocol

**Tether is a No-Log System.**
* No personal data is stored in Stroma Labs databases.
* No Google Sheets logging.
* All analysis is performed in RAM and is ephemeral (erased upon session close).

### Tech Stack

* **Engine:** Python 3.12
* **Interface:** Streamlit
* **Intelligence:** Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (via API)
* **Parsing:** PyMuPDF (PDF) & Python-Docx (Word)
